# DarkSpawner
CapstoneProject


This project was made as a spawning game (you spawn minions to fight for you) where the goal is to position your entities properly so you don't lose.

Despite being somewhat janky (i was the only one working on this ) this was the most stable game I've ever built, and I had learned how to program many thing which i thought were impossible for my abilities. So despite the roughness, I feel surprisingly proud of this.
